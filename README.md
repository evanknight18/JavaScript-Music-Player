AS a lover of music

I WANT to use a single page web-based music player wherein once I select a genre it starts playing through songs of that genre while giving me the option to go back, pause/play, shuffle, repeat, and scroll through different points in the song, this is accomplished,

SO THAT I can put together a list of songs that save as a playlist
